# Bayes-Iso

This repository contains a [Python implementation of the Non-parametric Bayesian Isotonic Calibration](newcal.py) (Bayes-Iso) algorithm. The rest of the code is the experiment conducted to compare Bayes-Iso to other calibration methods like Isotonic calibration, Logistic calibration, Beta calibration and ENIR. Descriptions and results can be found in the corresponding article published in ECML2019.
